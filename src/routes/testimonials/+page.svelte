						"I recently got my hands on Flowbite Pro, and holy crap, I'm speechless with how easy
						this was to integrate within my application. Most templates are a pain, code is
						scattered, and near impossible to theme.
					</p>
					<p class="my-4">
						Flowbite has code in one place and I'm not joking when I say it took me a matter of
						minutes to copy the code, customise it and integrate within a Laravel + Vue application.
					</p>
					<p class="my-4">If you care for your time, I hands down would go with this."</p>
