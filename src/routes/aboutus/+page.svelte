						Hon’ble Shri Dineshkumar Bobade is the architect of Nagar Yuwak Shikshan Santha, Nagpur.
						He has been the guiding star in spreading the light of education. His can-do-more
						attitude brought about an intellectual revolution that has transformed the social,
						educational, economic and cultural life of rural Maharashtra. One lamp that lit strongly
						and firmly with a great vision of spreading the light of wisdom is our Hon’ble Shri
						Dattaji Meghe the Chairman of Nagar Yuwak Shikshan Sanstha & Founder Chancellor of Datta
						Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences University is in active public life for more than 35
						years. He represented the people of Maharashtra in Lok Sabha for 3 consecutive terms &
						was the Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha). He strongly believed that quality Education
						& Health can only bring the true transformation of the huge human resources of our
						nation. In pursuit of our Chairman’s social commitment, a modest beginning was made by
						starting a small educational institute 36 years ago, which has grown up into a an
						educational empire covering almost all faculties of education spread all over
						Maharashtra state. This educational society has established 27 institutions right from
						pre-primary to postgraduate levels covering various faculties like Medical Sciences,
						Pharmacy, Engineering, Social Science, Commerce, Science, Physical Education and
						Performing Arts. The Society is like a joint family of about 30000 students and about
						1500 highly educated and skilled staff. Our founder Chairman Shri Dattaji Meghe insists
						on good quality education, discipline and welfare of the students and the staff.
